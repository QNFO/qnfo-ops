# FLEET CALIBRATION & STRESS-TESTING — qnfo-fleet-calibrator

> Version 1.0.0 (2026-09-04). Canonical source: QNFO/qnfo-workers/qnfo-fleet-calibrator.
> Deployment: `wrangler deploy` from that dir; then `cp worker.js deployed-current.worker.js`.
> Runbook owner: autonomous scheduled layer (CLOUD-FRONTEND-ONLY-1).

## Purpose

Scheduled, server-side, 100% autonomous calibration/stress-testing of fleet-wide
infrastructure performance, with **self-auditing, self-correcting and self-improving**
properties and **reversible autonomous adjustments**. No user effort is required after deploy.

## What runs when (Cloudflare Cron Triggers)

| Cron (UTC) | Type | Content |
|---|---|---|
| 0 3 * * * | daily | Full static probe set (8 HTTP via service bindings + public sites, D1, R2, Vectorize) |
| 30 3 * * 1 | stress (weekly, Sunday) | daily + adversarial input battery + 8-way burst concurrency + plan-weight tuning |
| 0 4 1 * * | monthly | stress + retention cleanup (90d metrics / 30d resolved anomalies / 7d R2 cal prefix) |

Missed crons are detected (NO-CATCH-UP-1 style: schedule-gap recorded, next fire recovers).

## Endpoints

| Route | Auth | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET /health | none | worker/version/last_run/open_anomalies |
| POST /run?type=daily|stress|monthly&simulate=anomaly | X-Run-Key | manual trigger (used by ops + this runbook's verification) |
| GET /diag?url= | X-Run-Key | single fetch diagnostic (browser UA) |
| GET /report | X-Run-Key | runs/anomalies/baselines/actions/learnings JSON |

Secret: `RUN_SECRET` (mirrored to ~/.env CALIBRATOR_RUN_SECRET). Auth compare is timing-safe.

## Self-* design

- **Self-auditing**: every run writes `verdict_score` (completeness/integrity/plausibility checks) + audit_json. Simulate mode proves the detector fires on injected extreme input.
- **Self-correcting**: per-probe retry-once; rollback engine verifies prior autonomous actions every run and reverts drift with an audit row + learning; simulated anomalies are auto-resolved when the probe is clean.
- **Self-improving**: EMA baselines with variance-adaptive thresholds; 7d failure-rate probe weighting; learnings table; KV config recommendations published to `qnfo-fleet-config/latest`.
- **Autonomous adjustments (allowlist, reversible, binding-only)**: tune-threshold, tune-plan, publish-config, retention-cleanup. Every action has before/after JSON, verified next run, rollback on regression.

## Data model (qnfo-audit D1, fleet_cal_*)

runs / metrics / baselines / anomalies / actions / learnings / state. Probe traffic is
self-generated calibration traffic (IMPRESSIONS-ZONE-NOT-WORKER-1) and never counted as external.
