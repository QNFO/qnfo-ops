# Cloud-Native Autonomous Operations Plan — Entire Ecosystem

**Status:** active (P0) · **Authority:** 100%-cloud-native user directive (2026-09-02) + NO-DEFERRED-ZERO-1
· **Last updated:** 2026-09-02 · Canonical repo: QNFO/qnfo-ops

Design goal: continuous execution, auditing/monitoring, continuous improvement (kaizen), and
upgrades/optimizations run AUTOMATICALLY across the fleet with zero manual user intervention.
Cloudflare is canonical; local Windows state is an ephemeral, device-bound mirror only.

## Layer 0 — Continuous execution (unattended, scheduled)

| Mechanism | Schedule (UTC) | What it runs |
|---|---|---|
| qnfo-cloud-ops v1.8.1 (cloud scheduler) | see crons | email-triage/gmail-triage/briefing/research-scan/outreach/weekly/weekly-ops/portfolio-sync/zenodo-stats/board-sync/release-check/nlnet/worker-health/sitemap-ping/loose-threads-sweep |
| errata subprocess (qnfo-errata-watch/respond/publish) | :00 / :15 / :30 hourly | inbound-email triage -> errata_queue -> errata_actions -> automated new-version publish |
| qnfo-arxiv-radar | 30 8 * * * | arxiv new-paper radar |
| qnfo-citation-watch | 0 11 1,15 * * | citation change watch |
| qnfo-research-radar | 0 6 1 * * + 0 8 * * 7 | research/monthly radar |
| qnfo-twin-maintain | 0 4 * * * | twin maintenance |
| qnfo-skill-sync | 0 3 * * * | skills repo -> R2 mirror |
| qnfo-lifecycle | hourly + monthly | lifecycle ops |
| qnfo-blank-audit | 40 4 * * * (verified) | blank/fallback gateway audit |
| edge idea intake | event | ChatBox/Android -> qnfo-ai -> glm intent classifier -> orchestrator |

## Layer 1 — Auditing / monitoring

| Mechanism | Cadence | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| worker-health (in qnfo-cloud-ops) | 2x/day 12h apart (03:05/15:05) | fleet endpoint + /health checks; digest on failure |
| loose-threads-sweep | Mon 05:00 | unfinished WBS states / open handoffs / open tasks >7d; digest cap 40 |
| Fleet Drift & Self-Improvement Audit (42b1988c, device) | Mon 06:00 | regenerates FLEET-MANIFEST.md, flags self-doc drift, repairs via wrangler |
| scheduler-guard.py (device) | every ops cycle | local cron registry == canonical set, <=1x/day, no residue |
| disk-guard.py (device) | daily 07:30 | C: free-space WARN/CRIT out-of-band alert |
| qnfo-system-health | 0 5 * * * | blank-response analytics |
| QNFO Data Freshness Sync (aa67d355, device) | daily 05:12 | Outlook COM calendar + received email -> orchestrator/Vectorize |
| infra_status / infra_records / infra_analytics MCP | on-demand | Cloudflare API snapshot (workers/D1/Vectorize/R2/KV/AI Gateway) |
| cost control | continuous | AI Gateway spend_limit; $90/30d budget audit (neurons) |

## Layer 2 — Continuous improvement (kaizen)

| Mechanism | Cadence | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| qnfo-kaizen worker | 0 2 * * * + 0 10 * * 1 | scheduled kaizen processing |
| CMD SKILLS UPDATE cycles (in-app) | session | dual-write + 7-store parity + prompt-store-verify exit 0 |
| fleet-manifest-sweep + prompt-store-verify + dr_validate_schema | inside backup/drift | gates before every closeout |
| loose-threads-sweep feed | weekly | surfaces loose threads for next ops cycle disposition |

## Layer 3 — Upgrades / optimization

| Mechanism | Cadence | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| release-check | 04:15 daily | DeepChat stable release alert (DEEPCHAT-RELEASE-TRACK-1) |
| Fleet drift repair | weekly | redeploy canonical bundle where repo != live |
| portfolio-sync / board-sync | Mon/Sat | GitHub mirror self-heal (direct-main, no PR churn) |
| sitemap-ping | monthly 1st | sitemap health ping |
| MODEL-KEY / param alignment | session | DEEPCHAT-DEFAULT-MODEL-1 + MODEL-PARAM-STORE-ALIGN-1 guards (app-device writes need app) |

## Device-bound residue (sanctioned; NOT cloud-able)

DeepChat local cron canonical set (scheduler-guard PASS): 42b1988c (fleet drift, repo+wrangler),
aa67d355 (Outlook COM freshness), c7f96688 (MCP token refresh), 2055e49c (one-shot 2026-11-06),
6e91c844 (disk guard). Windows Task QNFO-AgentDB-Daily-Backup (daily 21:30, runs WITHOUT DeepChat
open; agent.db + config -> R2 qnfo-backups). Wrapper embeds a CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN copy - see
SECRETS-INVENTORY rotation note.

## Residual manual / user-side (owned, triggered, never silent)

GitHub org runners billing (user) · workers.dev routing 10405 token scope (token rotation
opportunity) · personal .ics custom domain for public serving (cloud-able, planned) · email-key
rotation coordination (write-only verification) · DeepChat app installs (device by design;
release-check alerts). Each is surfaced by loose-threads-sweep / worker-health / weekly drift
until closed; none rests with only an owner label.

## Fleet self-doc status (2026-09-02 manifest, 52 workers)

~25 workers are GAP (no canonical repo dir or NO-HEALTH) - tracked by the weekly Fleet Drift audit
(42b1988c) for incremental conversion; the fleet-manifest-sweep re-generates FLEET-MANIFEST.md each
week. qnfo-cloud-ops mirror in qnfo-workers synced to v1.8.1 (b7e2065) so the next regeneration shows
repo==live. Concurrent-session dirt (qnfo-ai/worker.js, qnfo-pdf/) left untouched per GIT-OWNERSHIP-1.
